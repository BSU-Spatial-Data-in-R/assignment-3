# assignment-3
This is the third assignment of the semester for HES 505.

The third part of the course was designed to introduce to help you tie together the syntax you've learned so far to be able to conduct different kinds of spatial analyses. The ability to move from reading and manipulating your data towards a statistical analysis that is both geographically correct and statistically robust will we require you to integrate a variety of the techniques you've learned for manipulating tabular, `sf`, and raster objects. This assignment asks you to demonstrate those skills in a variety of ways. By the end of this assignment you should be able to:

* Combine tabular, `sf`, and raster datasets using joins and extractions

* Generate kernel density estimates and estimate spatial autocorrelation

* Conduct a series of 'suitability' analyses using weighted and statistical overlays

* Evaluate the quality of your models using confusion matrices and statistical tests

## Instructions

1. After you've joined the assignment repository, you should have this file (named Readme.md) inside of a R project named assignment-1-xx where xx is your github username (or initials). All of the data should be accessible on the server at `/opt/data/2022/assignment03/`.

2. Once you've verified that you've correctly cloned the assignment repository, create a new Quarto document. Name this file assignment-3-xxx.qmd and give it a title (like M Williamson Assignment 3). Make sure that you select the html output option (Quarto can do a lot of cool things, but the html format is the least-likely to cause you additional headaches). We'll be using Quarto throughout the course so it's worth checking out the other tutorials in the getting started section.

3. Copy the questions below into your document and change the color of their text.

4. Save the changes and make your first commit!

5. Answer the questions making sure save and commit at least 4 more times (having 5 commits is part of the assignment).

6. Render the document to html (you should now have at least 3 files in the repository: Readme.md, assignment-1-xx.qmd, and assignment-1-xx.html). Commit these changes and push them to the repository on GitHub. You should see the files there when you go to github.com.
